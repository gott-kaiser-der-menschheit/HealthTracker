# HealthTracker


The problem statement of a health tracker can be broadly defined as the need to monitor and track an individual's physical activity levels, vital signs, and overall
health and wellness in order to help them maintain a healthy lifestyle. Health trackers may include wearable devices, smartphone apps, or other tools that collect 
and analyze data on an individual's sleep patterns, heart rate, steps taken, calories burned, and other health-related metrics. The goal of a health tracker is to
provide users with insights into their overall health and wellness, and to help them make informed decisions about their lifestyle choices in order to improve their
overall well-being.
